# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project 
As part of the course project I have submitted a R script named run_analysis.R
which will clean the dataset provided.The codebook.txt contains the detail   documentation for following my code.

## Step 1
Checking if the dataset directory exists or not to proceed further.

## Step 2
Read the necessary files(training set data,test set data and the file containing the features and activity list were read as these are the required files that i need to proceed.)

## step 3
Added subject and activity values to the training and test sets

## step 4 
Merged the the tarining and test set

## setp 6
Extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement along with subject and activity

## step 7
Modified the activity values with meaningful names

## step 8
Modified the column variables with more meaningful names

## step 9
created an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each
activity and each subject

## step 10
wrote the data out to a file
