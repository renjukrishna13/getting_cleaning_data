Checked the existence of "UCI HAR Dataset"

Read the training set file - UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt using read.table and stored the data frame as training
Read the training subject file - UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt using read.table and stored as train_sub_values
Read train activity values - UCI HAR Dataset/train/Y_train.txt using read.table and stored as train_activity_values

Read the test set file - UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt using read.table and stored the data frame as test
Read the test subject file - UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt using read.table and stored as test_sub_values
Read test activity values - UCI HAR Dataset/test/Y_test.txt using read.table and stored as train_activity_values

Read the feature name file UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt using read.table and stored the data frame as feature_names

Read the activity labels file UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt using read.table and stored the data frame as activity

Added subject and activity values to the training and test sets .. ie created training$subject,training$activity, test$subject,test$activity

Added the feature labels as the column names along with subject and activity column labels changing to subject_id and activity_id

Merged the training and test datasets using rbind and stored it in dataframe myset


Extracted the columns containing mean and standard deviation using select from "dplyr " package . The contains argument was used to select the column containing "-mean()","-std()" and then to avoid column containing(-contains) "-meanFreq()" . And the myset dataframe overwritten with this selected data frame

Modified the activity id using meaning full names . This was done with a merge between activity and myset and stored the data into myset_final. The acivity_id column was removed.

Modified column variables with meaning full names. Did some string transformation using gsub. 
 - Removed all ()
 - modified std to stdDeviation
 - modified t to time
 - modified f to frequency

myset_final after all the above steps contains the tidy dataset after step 4

my_tidy_set was created by grouping the myset_final by subject_id and activity  and then calculated the columnwise mean using ncolwise()

The final my_tidy_set was written to a text file named "Tidy_data_set.txt"
